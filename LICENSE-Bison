This code includes parsers generated by the Gnu Bison parser generator

http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html 


When Bison generates code, it inserts GPL license into the generated
code, along with an exception for using the generated code in non-gpl
products:

/* As a special exception, when this file is copied by Bison into a
   Bison output file, you may use that output file without restriction.
   This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation
   in version 1.24 of Bison.  */

In addition, there is an IBM copyright notice that is copied into the
Bison output files.


I certify that the Bison output files that reside in this source
repository have not been edited or otherwise altered in any way after being 
output by Bison, and that the special exception above applies to them.
